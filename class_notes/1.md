# Learn to Program

## What is Programming?

* It's telling a computer what to do
* Using a language to manipulate tools the computer already gives you

## What to Remember

* A programming language is a human language, so it will have errors
* It has a _syntax_
* Like a language, there are several ways to express something
* Becoming a good programmer is about learning the community's _style_

* Reference: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

* Remember that a computer is a stack, remember your context
* You don't need to know every layer to be effective and build things
* Growing your knowledge of how it all fits together is what's fun about computers

## Variables

* A grab bag, also known as the _namespace_
* _Scope_
* Variables represent other things
* Difference between ‘data’ and ‘code’
* `var a = "string"`

# Data Types

* Numbers
1 === 1.0

* Strings
"this" === 'this'

* Booleans
true
false

* Objects
{}

* null
Important concept in programming. Nothing, but not zero.
More intentional absence

* RegExps

* Functions
A way to encapsulate code, pass it around
Almost synonym: 'method'
